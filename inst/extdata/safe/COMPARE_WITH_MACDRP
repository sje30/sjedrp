When I compared with MacDRP, I got slightly different output.  Note
that I used different files (Mac line-endings, together with bogus
extra points, as I worried about how drp was cutting out the cell
pairs.  Results seem close-enough now.)

These mac files were created uising the sjedrp routine drp.makemac()
pdf output made by using grab to get the images then throw them into
TextEdit.
