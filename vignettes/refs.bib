  abstract = "The density recovery profile is a plot of the spatial density of
              a set of points as a function of the distance of each of those
              points from all the others. It is based upon a two-dimensional
              point autocorrelogram. If the points are randomly distributed,
              then the profile is flat, with a value equal to the mean spatial
              density. Thus, any deviation from this value indicates that the
              presence of the object represented by the point alters the
              probability of encountering nearby objects of the same set.
              Increased value near an object indicates clustering, decreased
              value near an object indicates anticlustering. The method appears
              to be unique in its ability to provide quantitative measures of
              the anticlustered state. Two examples are presented. The first is
              based upon a sample of the distribution of the somata of
              starburst amacrine cells in the macaque retina; the second is
              based upon the distribution of the terminal enlargements on the
              dendrites of a single macaque ganglion cell that projects to the
              superior colliculus. In both cases, the density recovery profile
              is initially lower than the mean density, and increases up to the
              plateau at the value of the mean density. Two useful measures can
              be derived from this profile: an intensive parameter termed the
              effective radius, which quantifies the extent of the region of
              decreased probability and is insensitive to random undersampling
              of the underlying distribution, and an extensive parameter termed
              the packing factor, which quantifies the degree of packing
              possible for a given effective radius, and is insensitive to
              scaling. An extension of this method, applicable to correlations
              between two superimposed distributions, and based upon a
              two-dimensional point cross-correlogram, is also described.",

  title    = "Spatial properties of retinal mosaics: an empirical evaluation of
              some existing measures",
  author   = "Cook, J E",
  abstract = "Mosaics of neurons are usually quantified by methods based on
              nearest-neighbor distance (NND). The commonest indicator of
              regularity has been the ratio of the mean NND to the standard
              deviation, here termed the 'conformity ratio.' However, an
              accurate baseline value of this ratio for bounded random samples
              has never been determined; nor was its sampling distribution
              known, making it impossible to test its significance. Instead,
              significance was assessed from goodness-of-fit to a Rayleigh
              distribution, or from another ratio, that of the observed mean
              NND to an expected mean predicted by theory, termed the
              dispersion index. Neither approach allows for boundary effects
              that are common in experimental mosaics. Equally common are
              'missing' neurons, whose effects on the statistics have not been
              studied. To address these deficiencies, random patterns and real
              neuronal mosaics were analyzed statistically. Ns independent
              random-point samples of size Np were generated for 13 Np values
              between 25 and 6400, where Ns x Np > or = 144,000. Samples were
              generated with rectangular boundaries of aspect ratio 1:1, 1:5,
              and 1:10 to examine the influence of sample geometry. NND
              distributions, conformity ratios, and dispersion indices were
              computed for the resulting 45,997 independent random patterns.
              From these, empirical sampling distributions and critical values
              were determined. NND distributions for small-to-medium, bounded,
              random populations were shown to differ significantly from
              Rayleigh distributions. Thus, goodness-of-fit tests are invalid
              for most experimental mosaics. Charts are presented from which
              the significance of conformity ratios or dispersion indices can
              be read directly. The conformity ratio reacts conservatively to
              extremes of sample geometry, and provides a useful and safe test.
              The dispersion index is nonconservative, making its use
              problematic. Tests based on the theoretical distribution of the
              dispersion index are unreliable for all but the largest samples.
              Random deletions were also made from 33 real retinal ganglion
              cell mosaics. The mean NND, conformity ratio, and dispersion
              index were determined for each original mosaic and 36 independent
              samples at each of nine sampling levels, retaining between 90\%
              and 10\% of the original population. An exclusion radius, based
              on a spatial autocorrelogram, was also calculated for each of
              these 10,725 mosaic samples. The mean NND was moderately
              insensitive to undersampling, rising smoothly. The exclusion
              radius was remarkably insensitive. The conformity ratio and
              dispersion index fell steeply, sometimes failing to reach
              significance while half of the cells still remained. For the same
              33 original mosaics, linear regression showed the exclusion
              radius to be 62 +/- 3\% of the mean NND.",
